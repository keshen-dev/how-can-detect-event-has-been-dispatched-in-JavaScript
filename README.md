# how-can-detect-event-has-been-dispatched-in-JavaScript

In JavaScript, you can use an event listener to detect when an event has been dispatched and then execute a function after the event has completed.

Here is an example of how you can set a function to execute after an event has been dispatched:

```
// Get the element that dispatches the event
const myButton = document.getElementById("my-button");

// Add an event listener to the element
myButton.addEventListener("click", function() {
  console.log("Button clicked!");
  
  // Call your function after the event has completed
  window.setTimeout(function() {
    console.log("Function executed after event completion!");
  }, 0);
});

// Dispatch the event
const event = new Event("click");
myButton.dispatchEvent(event);
```
In this example, we add an event listener to a button element that logs a message to the console when the button is clicked. After the event completes, we use window.setTimeout to set a function to execute with a delay of 0 milliseconds. This ensures that the function is executed after the event has completed.

Finally, we dispatch the event using dispatchEvent. When the button is clicked, the event listener is called, and the function is executed after the event completes.
